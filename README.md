# Running your own Streamlit hackathon

This repository provides all the resources needed to organize your own Streamlit-focused hackathon or to include Streamlit in a hackathon you're already planning.

Let's dive into the resources.

## Introductory slide decks
Check out the [intro to Streamlit slide deck](Intro_to_Streamlit.pptx). Feel free to present these to your hackathon attendees at the beginning of your hackathon to familiarize them with Streamlit. If you'd prefer to have the Streamlit team do the talking, there are also video options.

## Introductory videos
Showing an introductory video about Streamlit is a great way to kick off your hackathon. Luckily, there are tons of great videos that provide an intro to Streamlit.

Here are some of our favorites:

## Challenge statements
A hackathon challenge statement is a concise description of the challenge that participants are expected to address and solve during the hackathon event. It outlines the specific problem or goal that participants need to tackle using their creativity, technical skills, and innovative thinking.
