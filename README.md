# Running your own Streamlit hackathon

So you want to host a Streamlit hackathon ... you're in the right place! This repository provides all the resources needed to organize your own Streamlit-focused hackathon or to include Streamlit in a hackathon you're already planning.

Let's dive into an overview of the resources.

### Introductory Streamlit slide decks
You'll find several options for slide decks that provide an introduction to Streamlit. Feel free to present these to your hackathon attendees at the beginning of your hackathon to familiarize them with Streamlit. If you'd prefer to have the Streamlit team do the talking, there are also video options.
Check out the slide decks [here](https://github.com/carolinedlu/streamlit-hackathon/tree/main/slides).

### Introductory Streamlit videos
You'll also notice a guide that aggregates links to the best introductory Streamlit videos. Some of these were created by the Streamlit team, while others were filmed by the Streamlit community.
