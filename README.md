# How to run your own Streamlit hackathon 

This repository provides all the resources needed to organize your own Streamlit-focused hackathon or to include Streamlit in a hackathon you're already planning.

Let's dive in!

## 1. Introduction to Streamlit presentation 🧑‍🏫
At the beginning of your hackathon, you may want to present an introduction to Streamlit to teach your hackers the basics. We have an [intro to Streamlit slide deck](Intro_to_Streamlit.pptx) that you can use for this purpose, or you can share one of the [intro to Streamlit videos](https://github.com/carolinedlu/streamlit-hackathon/blob/main/videos.md) with your attendees.

## 2. Challenge statements 📝
A hackathon challenge statement is a concise description of the challenge that participants are expected to address and solve during the hackathon event. It outlines the specific problem or goal that participants need to tackle using their creativity, technical skills, and innovative thinking.

Dive into a variety of Streamlit-related challenge statements [here](https://github.com/carolinedlu/streamlit-hackathon/tree/main/challenge-statements).

## 3. Support for app builders 🏗️
