# Challenge Statement 1: Build a Chatbot using Streamlit

Your mission is to use Streamlit to build a chatbot app that connects to a large language model or API of your choice.

You'll want to use Streamlit's [chat elements](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/chat), including [`st.chat_message`](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/chat/st.chat_message) and [`st.chat_input`](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/chat/st.chat_input) to create your chatbot's UI.

Once you've set up your chatbot UI, it's up to you to pick a large language model or API to connect to the chatbot.

You may want to consider:
- [GPT 3.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5)
- [Llama 2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/)
- [OpenAssistant LLaMa 30B SFT 6](https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-6-llama-30b-xor)
- [Stable Beluga 2](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/StableBeluga2)
- [Claude 2](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2)
