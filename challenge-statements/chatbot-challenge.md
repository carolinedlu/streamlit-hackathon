# Challenge Statement 1: Build a Chatbot using Streamlit

Your mission is to use Streamlit to build a chatbot app that connects to a large language model or API of your choice.

You'll want to use Streamlit's [chat elements](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/chat), including [`st.chat_message`](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/chat/st.chat_message) and [`st.chat_input`](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/chat/st.chat_input) to create your chatbot's UI.

Once you've set up your chatbot UI, it's up to you to pick a large language model or API to connect to the chatbot.
